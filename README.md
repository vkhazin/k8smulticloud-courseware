## Overview

An introductory course to deploy workloads on multiple cloud providers leveraging Kubernetes as a common platform.
The course walks participants through the concepts of containerization and commonly accepted Kubernetes practices.
Participants will author a Dockerfile to package a sample application into a docker image, to compose a Kubernetes pod and to deploy to multiple Kubernetes-as-a-Service providers.
Hands-on labs will focus on similarities and differences between leading public cloud Kubernetes providers, best practices, and common setbacks.
The course will also introduce configuration, security, back-end, logging, and monitoring utilizing Kubernetes and/or cloud-native services.
